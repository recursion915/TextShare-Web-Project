Who is the target audience for your Web application?

[Optional stretch goal: Identify a target audience that none of your group members belong to. This will make your project more unique than a Web app for college students.]

Our target audiences are mainly college students, who seek to use textbooks and textbooks owners. 

What problem is it intended to solve for that audience?



How will it meet the minimum project requirements?

Users can create accounts to become both textbook provider and receiver, and post textbook info on a webpage
Users can search for the textbooks they intend to rent and search results will be presented on a webpage 
Users can update their existing posts
Users can delete their posts and accounts

Purpose

Our textbook rental website applies the ideas of "shareing economy" and "P2P rental market". Our purpose is to make it easier for textbook owners and those who seek 
to use textbooks find each other. On one hand, it allows book owners to make money from underused textbooks. On the other hand, it enables whoever seek to use 
textbooks to rent them with cheaper prices.
